# AI Sonnets

AI Sonnets is a project that explores the generation of sonnets using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The project leverages machine learning algorithms to create unique and creative sonnets, inspired by the works of famous poets.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a model capable of generating sonnets that resemble the style and structure of traditional poetry. By training a deep learning model on a dataset of sonnets, the AI Sonnets project aims to produce compelling and evocative pieces of poetry.

## Features

The AI Sonnets project offers the following features:

1. Sonnet Generation: The core functionality of the project is the generation of sonnets by utilizing an AI model. The model has been trained on a diverse range of sonnets to produce coherent and meaningful compositions.

2. Interactive Interface: The project includes an interactive web interface built with Flask, where users can input the starting line of a sonnet and receive generated sonnets in response. The interface offers a seamless experience for users to interact with the AI model and explore the creative outputs.

## Technologies Used

The AI Sonnets project is built using the following technologies:

- TensorFlow: A powerful open-source machine learning framework used for training and deploying deep learning models.

- Python: The programming language used to implement the AI Sonnets project and its various components.

- Flask: A lightweight web framework used to build the interactive interface for the AI Sonnets project.

## Installation

To run the AI Sonnets project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/rithurajnambiar17/ai-sonnets.git


2. Install the required dependencies:
